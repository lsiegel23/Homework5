What Is It?
This project was to help a customer visualize his or her investments over the course of 30 years. Through python, pandas, alpaca, and json I was able to run a Monte Carlo Simulation to project the customer's earnings. These softwares made it easy to:
- Determine the investments in the customer's portfolio
- Accurately predict their earnings after the course of 30 years
- Visualize the possibilities of how the portfolio would perform
- Adjust the allotment of investments to make sure the portfolio would achieve the level of success the customer was looking for.
Through the functions I created, I was able to determine which assests where best to invest in over the long term and which assests would be a good buy and hold investment. This notebook makes it easy to determine how the retirement plan would perform over the course of the 30 years and if it would be wise to invest in certain stocks/crypto currencies.
